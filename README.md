# Sales-Manager-snippet
Create a program that will help a manager determine the amount of commission to pay their sales persons depending on the sales they have sold. The commission  percentages are as follows;

0-1000                   1%

Above 1000-5000          3%

Above 5000-10000         5%

Above 10,000             10%

The program should allow the manager to enter the name, payroll number and the amount of sales the sales person has sold.

The program output should be able to display sales person name, payroll no, amount of sales, commission amount and the total salary.

The total salary is a sum of the commission and the retainer amount. The retainer amount for all the sales persons is Kshs.25,000.
